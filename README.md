## What kind of script is this?
The script generates a web.yml file with a password hash using [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt), which is necessary to enable basic authentication for Prometheus.

## How does it work?
The script prompts for username and password.
When you enter username and password, you need waiting 10 seconds timeout for bcrypt processing.
- If there is a web.yml file, you will be prompted to either recreate it or add credentials to the end of the file.
- If there is no web.yml file, a new file will be generated.

After, you need add web.yml to Prometheus configuration:
```
--web.config.file=/etc/prometheus/web.yml
```
